# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
##### The collect_data.py is used to build the dataset. The dataset must have two folders- one for the training data and the other for testing.Each folder must be split into multiple sub-folders, to record images of the gestures.This project utilises 100 images for each gesture to train the model, and 10 images to test it.
##### The train_data.py and predict.py files are used to train the model and predict data respectively.
